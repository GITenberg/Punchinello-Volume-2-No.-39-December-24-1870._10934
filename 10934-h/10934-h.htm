      <p><small>I have a Wheeler &amp; Wilson machine (No. 289), bought
of Mr. Gardner in 1853, he having used it a year. I have used it
constantly, in shirt manufacturing as well as family sewing, sixteen
years. My wife ran it four years, and earned between $700 and $800,
besides doing her housework. I have never expended fifty cents on it
for repairs. It is, to-day, in the best of order, stitching fine linen
bosoms nicely. I started manufacturing shirts with this machine, and
now have over one hundred of them in use. I have paid at least $3,000
for the stitching done by this old machine, and it will do as much now
as any machine I have.</small></p>

      <p>By MOSE SKINNER,</p>
      <p>CHAPTER SIXTH.</p>
      <p>ANN'S RECEPTION.</p>
      <p>The next morning, as ANN was eating breakfast, who should
drive up in a
covered wagon but the Hon. MICHAEL.</p>
      <p>"Just as I expected," said she. "They've found out where I am,
and
they'll come out here and try to pump me about it. But I don't envy 'em
their job. Come in," she added, in answer to the Hon. MICHAEL'S
somewhat
timid knock.</p>
      <p>"How'd'do, ANN," said he. "Sister-in-law said you was here,
and I
thought I'd come over and see you. Besides," he continued, in evident
embarrassment, "there's one or two things I thought you'd like to know."</p>
      <p>"Well?" said she, as he paused. "Out with it, old fellow.
Don't be
bashful."</p>
      <p>"Oh! I ain't," he replied, rubbing his knees nervously. "Well,
in the
fust place, the old lady is awfully down on you, says you've disgraced
the family, and she disowns you, and all that sort of humbug, but I
shet
her up by telling her that whatever she said agin <i>you</i>, she said
agin <i>me</i>." He looked at ANN admiringly, and, taking from his
pocket a large
package of red and white candy, handed it to her. Then he turned very
red in the face, looked hard at the ceiling, and repeated Mrs. LADLE'S
message all over again.</p>
      <p>"First thing, <i>told</i>," said he.</p>
      <p>It was plain to ANN that he had really come with the intention
of making
love to her, but was anxious to find how the land lay first. But she
didn't give him any encouragement. Under existing circumstances, she
didn't think 'twould be right.</p>
      <p>"Well," said she, "anything else?"</p>
      <p>"Oh yes, I believe so,&#8212;ah&#8212;BELINDA sends love, and is jest
about crazy
to see you, and hear all about it. Shouldn't wonder a bit if she was
over here afore the day's over."</p>
      <p>He moved his chair nearer hers, glanced at her furtively, and
sighed
deeply.</p>
      <p>"Second thing, told," said he.</p>
      <p>"Well, I'm much obliged to you. Items of gossip are victuals
and drink
to our sex, you know. Don't be in a hurry," she continued, seeing that
he showed no signs of going. "Looking for your hat? Yes, here it is.
Let
me put it on for you," she added in her gentle, winning way. "Good-by.
To think," she added, looking after him, "that the old pill should get
spoony on <i>me</i>!"</p>
      <p>Sure enough, in the afternoon up drove BELINDA.</p>
      <p>"Awful glad to see you, ANN dear," said she, kissing her. "I'm
dying to
know all about it. As soon as I found out where you were, I rushed out
and hitched up the old mare myself. But I knew she'd never go so far
from home without an object in view to urge her. So I fastened a bag of
oats in front of her head. Didn't she just streak it? The idea of her
chasing them oats five miles before she caught 'em! She's out there now
eating 'em, propped up by a couple of fence-rails. But tell me, quick,
are you really married, as you said you'd be in that letter you left on
my wash-stand?"</p>
      <p>"Yes, I am," replied ANN.</p>
      <p>"Where's your husband? Who is he? Do tell me all about it.
Does he look
like anybody I know?"</p>
      <p>"Well, I should say he did." answered ANN, grinning. "You see
it's a
sort of a joke, BELINDA. You wouldn't see the point now, half as well
as
you will after you're married to ARCHIBALD. Then I'll tell you. Oh,
it's
too rich!" And she laughed immoderately.</p>
      <p>"Oh, I can't wait. Tell me now. If you will, I'll give you my
new <i>piqu&eacute;</i> and that bracelet. Come, why can't you?"</p>
      <p>"Because I don't choose to," replied ANN coolly.</p>
      <p>"Seems to me you're mighty short about it anyhow. Putting on
airs, ain't
you, because you got married before I did?"</p>
      <p>"Well, you needn't think nobody can get a fellow but you.
Pooh, I could
cut <i>you</i> out, any time."</p>
      <p>"Oh, you <i>could</i>, could you?" returned BELINDA in high
disdain. "Perhaps
you'd better try it on, with them freckles and that mole. I don't think
your husband, whoever he is, can brag much of his taste in the female
line. I'm sure <i>I</i> don't want to see him, so you can keep him
locked up,
you jealous thing. It's some old rowdy, I s'pose, that nobody else
would
look at. I hate you, and always did. Don't never come near me. There!"
And she left in high dudgeon.</p>
      <p>As she drove off, ANN stood by the window watching her. She
soliloquized, "So you think, Miss BELINDA, do you, 'that I'd better try
it on, with them freckles and that mole!' I think I <i>have</i> tried
it on,
and pretty effectually too. Just wait till you're married to BLINKSOP,
that's all."</p>
      <p>By dark she began to look impatiently for TEDDY, for she felt
sure he'd
find JEFFRY somewhere. It was nine o'clock, however, before he made his
appearance.</p>
      <p>"Did you find him?" she inquired eagerly.</p>
      <p>"I did, mum, sure, and a hard pull I had of it. I beat the
whole town
through, and at last I found him a rollin' bowly alleys, and I giv him
your letther. Sich dreadful swears as he giv, mum, a walkin' up and
down
an' a crushing his fingers like, and a bitin' his teeth together, and
then he stops in front of me, and says in an awful theatur voice, 'Tell
her,' says he, 'that I'll come,' and he giv me a kick, mum, as boosted
me clear to the sidewalk, and I see plainly as he had more remarks of
that same kind to deliver, and I edged off at about five miles an hour.
Goodnight to ye, mum."</p>
      <p>ANN slept calmly and sweetly that night, for the one cherished
idea of
her innocent girlhood was about to be consummated, and she smiled in
her
sleep and thought she saw her mother.</p>
      <p>JEFFRY MAULBOY kept his word. He was there at noon of the next
day. And
the minister that was to marry them, and the lawyer that was to divorce
them, were there also.</p>
      <p>At one o'clock they were man and wife, sworn to love, honor,
and obey
each other till death did them part. At a quarter of two o'clock they
were man and woman, sworn to love, honor, and obey anybody they wanted
to, for a divorce did them part. And they went their separate ways.</p>
      <br>
      <p>CHAPTER SEVENTH.</p>
      <p>WHERE IS ANN?</p>
      <p>BELINDA returned from the Half-Way House, firmly determined to
find out
all about that affair of ANN'S. Any woman would naturally feel curious
about it, and BELINDA really cannot be blamed for showing a little
feeling. "To think." said she, "after all my bragging that I'd be
married first, and the times I've twitted her of being too homely to
get
a beau, that she should step out and get married right under my very
nose, and I not know anything about it, or even who she's married. Oh,
it's <i>too</i> much. But I'll find out, if I die for it, and if there
      <i>is</i>
anything about it that ain't straight, won't I crow over her?"</p>
      <p>The Hon. MICHAEL was also very anxious to find out about it.
With the
affectionate ardor of a grass widower of fifty-five, in a State where
divorces sprout like mushrooms, he was loath to believe that ANN was
utterly lost to him. No, he would find her, he would follow her if
necessary to the world's end, living only in this hope, and when at
last
the goal was reached, and her adored form greeted his vision, he would
pour out his wealth of love, bending his ear to catch the sweet
response, and then, and only then, would everything be lovely.</p>
      <p>And so it comes that he and BELINDA, each with a different
motive, take
counsel together in reference to the same end.</p>
      <p>BELINDA'S first step was to send ARCHIBALD to the Half-Way
House, for a
full description of the man that called there for ANN.</p>
      <p>"Be smart for once in your life," said she, "and find out <i>something</i>."</p>
      <p>Then she and the Hon. MICHAEL started off to find out what
direction ANN
took after leaving the Half-Way House. They interviewed every
carriage-driver, depot-master, and hotel-keeper for miles around, but
without the slightest success. They finally came across a farmer,
however, who said be drove a woman to the station below. To their eager
inquiries as to her appearance, he could say nothing further, than he
thought she wore a dress, and was quite sure, though not certain, that
she had on either a shawl, or some other outside garment. He remembered
her distinctly, because the half-dollar she gave him turned out to be
counterfeit, and he got rid of it by giving it to a blind beggar; after
which, he said, he sneaked round the corner, and laughed till he was
red
in the face, to think how slick that beggar was fooled.</p>
      <p>This might be ANN, they thought, but to make sure, they
telegraphed to
six different stations, promising a small reward in case their pursuit
was successful. In due time the answers came, all very much alike, and
to the effect that a woman, answering their description, was seen to
take such and such a train, and that the reward would reach them at the
following address, etc.; at which they went home rather discouraged, to
see what ARCHIBALD had accomplished.</p>
      <p>He said he went to the Half-way House, and questioned Mrs.
BACKUP and
TEDDY for four hours, without finding out the first thing. "You're a
numskull," said BELINDA. "If I hadn't got any more brains than you
have,
I'd swap myself off for a dog, and then kill the dog."</p>
      <p>"I don't believe the folks there would tell, anyhow," said the
Hon.
MICHAEL; "she's probably hired 'em to keep mum."</p>
      <p>Now the fact was, ARCHIBALD hadn't been near the Half-way
House at all.
There wasn't money enough in the State to hire him to do so, after the
fearful ordeal he had there passed through. So he hid in the woods all
day, and rehearsed this terrible falsehood, making himself miserable by
repeating those extracts from the catechism which refer to the future
abode of liars.</p>
      <p>Though thus foiled in their active investigations, they still
held long
consultations on the absorbing topic, and in which, to ARCHIBALD'S
horror, he is often obliged to participate. He has had it on his
tongue's end forty times to tell BELINDA all about his forced marriage
with ANN at the Half-way House. He has even dreamed, on two separate
nights, that he has done so, but he woke up both times in a cold,
clammy
sort of ooze, and it has naturally shaken his confidence, and so the
words stick in his throat. And he remembers ANN'S horrible threat of
coming for him when she wants him, and he makes it a point of doing all
his out-door business before dark, and the bare mention of her name
will
make him start and glare wildly about him. And still BELINDA courts him
more persistently than ever, and it is a scene calculated to touch the
most rugged nature to watch them together, she smoothing his hair, and
calling him her "Tootsy-pootsy," or reading poetry to him, stopping
between each verse to cast languishing glances at him, and he bearing
it
all with that haggard, imbecile look peculiar to an over-courted man.
And as their wedding-day approaches is it any wonder that poor
ARCHIBALD
looks forward to it as a condemned criminal to the scaffold, and
watches
day by day the setting of the sun with the same air of grim despair.
Once he tried to run away, but BELINDA, in ambush, flanked him and led
him home. Then she sent for his trunk, and made him board there. And so
he is floating along in a hopeless sort of daze, a wretched victim of
diabolical circumstances.</p>
      <p>JEFFRY MAULBOY is visiting his brother JUDAS, at Terre Haute.
He has
signed articles of agreement for the great Prize Fight with SANDY
MCCORMICK, known for his prowess in the Ring as the "nasty masher." The
fight will take place some time during the winter, and JEFFRY will go
into training early in September. And the papers are full of
biographical sketches of the two combatants, together with comments on
their weight, general appearance, and a list of fights heretofore
participated in, with vague speculations as to the number of eyes,
fragments of ears, &amp;c., each one is supposed to possess, preserved
in
alcohol as trophies. And when JEFFRY appears in public the masses
regard
him with respectful admiration, and <i>gamins</i> applaud. And when he
gets
home he finds a brigade of those literary drummers, known as reporters,
sitting on his doorsteps, from beneath whose classic foreheads there
glares a wild and hungry eye, to be pacified only by a satisfactory
interview. The last exploit of the "Champion Nine" sinks into
insignificance beside this great, this momentous event, and the man who
walked a hundred miles in twenty-four hours is nowhere. He realizes the
cruel fact that Fame is fickle, and he makes one desperate effort to
grasp it, by offering determinedly to walk around the world in ninety
days, stopping for his gruel only at Hong Kong.</p>

      <p>Harrowing effects of the uncertainty of war news&#8212;Shocking
waste of
literary ammunition&#8212;A bill against the Provisional Government for
damages.</p>
      <p>TOURS, TENTH WEEK OF THE REPUBLIC, 1870.</p>
      <p>It was late in the afternoon when the intelligence arrived of
a decisive
victory for the army of General PALADINES, who had been manoeuvring for
nearly a fortnight to draw the Germans into a sort of <i>cul-de-sac</i>
formed by the extension of the French lines from Le Mans to Nogent and
Etamps.</p>
      <p>It came from such an authentic source, and had about it such
appearances
of probability, that I immediately retired to the silence of my chamber
for the purpose of preparing a graphic review of the French situation,
a
review in fact for which I had long sought some such opportunity. I had
made considerable progress with my paper, and was about to enter upon
that branch of the subject devoted to discussing the bearings of such a
victory upon the future prospects of France, when a tap at my door was
heard, and the red head of my landlady's first-born appeared.</p>
      <p>"Monsieur is wanted down stairs," said the boy, with an
alarmed look. I
hurried down and out into the street, only to be met by a messenger
from
the Hotel de Ville, with the information that later despatches
contradicted the victory. The shock to my feelings can only be
appreciated by a writer who feels that he has consumed thirty or forty
pages of foolscap in vain. I had been over two hours at that work. I
had
put all the brains I possessed in it. Many of the sentences so pleased
me that I had turned back with pardonable conceit to read them over and
admire them: but now, like a destroying angel, came the news that shook
from beneath my beautiful superstructure its very foundations, and left
me nothing but the humiliation of so much time and labor lost.</p>
      <p>I went back to my room, and cast myself on the bed in deep
affliction.
If I had been a single man I believe I could have hanged myself without
a pang. Sheer mortification soon lulled me to sleep, however, and when
a
second banging at my door awakened me it was nightfall, and there were
sounds of rapid movement and confusion outside. I put my head out of
the
window and heard a voice below, shouting:</p>
      <p>"The Germans are coming!"</p>
      <p>"S'death!" said I to myself, "what am I going to do?" My last
stitch of
clothing, save what I had on my back, was in the hands of the <i>blanchisseuse</i>,
and PIERRE of the carrot "top" had
possession of my
only pair of trousers for the purpose of cleaning them the following
morning. It would not have been a pleasant paragraph for me to read in
the newspapers that a correspondent bearing my name had been captured <i>in
puris naturalibus</i>. It would never do for an American to
be taken <i>sans culottes</i>, and then have the story of his surprise
reviewed by
English and Yankee critics.</p>
      <p>I don't know what I might have done in my distress; but kind
fortune
favored me, for the landlady, anticipating the probability of my being
disturbed by the commotion, knocked at the door to say that it was a
false alarm, and that the Germans, though victorious, had halted ten or
twelve miles from the city. Promptly, therefore, I dashed into the
midst
of another review of the French situation, predicated upon the late
French defeat. It was what I might call a perfect "stinger." It used
France up completely. The <i>grande nation</i> wasn't left a peg to
stand on;
and as for King WILLIAM, I proved him to be a butcher of the most
surpassing kind. In the short space of two hours I had covered
forty-three pages more of foolscap, and was about entering on my
forty-fourth, when there came a banging at my door for the third time,
and a despatch was handed me announcing that there <i>had been no
battle
at all!</i></p>
      <p>From early childhood I had been taught that "whom the Lord
loveth he
chasteneth," and, although the present circumstances clearly left me no
escape from the conviction that I must be an especial favorite of
Heaven, they could not prevent me from compensating my pent-up agony of
soul by literally eating seven and a half pages of my last "review." I
never knew before what "living on literary diet" meant, but I am wiser
now, and do not regret the "dread ordeal" by which I came to know all I
do know. Revenge occurred to me as the natural impulse of a man in such
a situation; but upon whom was I to be revenged? The government had
given currency to all these wild rumors; but it had too many heads for
me to punch. The job was bigger than I cared to undertake. The thought
occurred to me that I might present a bill of damages. Their sense of
justice would allow its fairness. I had been the dupe of false
intelligence, the victim of a series of frauds perpetrated to
"regulate"
the popular feeling. I did not debate the thought, but took my
resolution immediately, and drew up the following.</p>

      <p>I could not conceal from myself that the bill for damages was
altogether
too small; but as France is poor, and the demands upon her exchequer
are
great, I determined to send it just as it was, and wait in patience for
the result. I did so, and have been waiting ever since. The
recollection
of what the Judge told JOHN BUNYAN when he sent him to jail keeps me
up:
"Patient waiting, JOHN," observed the philosophic magistrate, "is no
loss." I try to fancy that I combine the patience of BUNYAN with the
philosophy of the Judge, and in that belief subscribe myself,

you
feel degraded every time you gaze on her. Style is everything in this
business. For the benefit of the rising generation I have written this
little treatise, which will elucidate all the mysteries of the marriage
business, and will make every man his own guide to wedded bliss.</p>
      <p>CHAPTER I.</p>
      <p>FINDING THE GAME.</p>
      <p>The true sportsman in this field is very wary. He casts his
optics
around him until he finds the bird for which he thinks he had better
go.
A vast amount of skill can properly be expended here. If the hunter is
young and rich, he can go for almost anything; if he is verging towards
gray hair and false teeth, he must not demand too much in the way of
beauty or money. If he has reached the well-preserved period, he can
have youth or beauty, but not wealth. No true sportsman ever goes for
brains, because it is almost impossible to find them, and, when found,
they are very unsatisfactory.</p>
      <p>If the bird is an orphan, examine the books in the Surrogate's
office

that complicates matters.</p>
      <p>If you have a hankering for widows, never run after one who
has been in
the business more than once. They become so knowing after two or three
trials. Besides, there is a fatality about some women&#8212;they're bound to
be widows. Furthermore, widows have a way of appearing to be loaded
down
with ducats, when, in reality, they are pawning the late defunct's
unmentionables for the means of existence.</p>
      <p>Always select young game, if possible, as it is more likely to
be tender
than that which has been condemned to the wall at numberless parties.
Game with freckles, or pimples, or cross eyes, can never be first-class.</p>
      <p>CHAPTER II.</p>
      <p>AMMUNITION.</p>
      <p>Too much care cannot be exercised in the selection of this
article. You
must take care that it is adapted to the game. If the bird be an
unbleached <i>blonde</i>, try first-class prayer-meetings, mild
decoctions of
Sunday-school exhibitions, parlor concerts, and readings. If it wear
spectacles, some light, airy, and poetical reading matter, like
BUTLER'S <i>Analogy</i>, or the <i>Tribune</i>, is useful. If the
bird be
a <i>brunette</i>, try
theatres, balls, operas, etc.; suppers at DEL.'S have been known to do
execution among this class. Never try lectures to young women with this
kind of bird. The bleached <i>blondes</i> are difficult to handle. If
you
suspect the bleaching, try a judicious mixture of both kinds of
ammunition.</p>
      <p>Some kinds of ammunition are adapted to all classes. Rings,
especially
diamonds, fans, bouquets, and jewels can be used in quantities only
limited by the amount of your bank account, or of your employer's petty
cash. I have seen a bracelet do the business at once, though, to be
sure, it was a very gorgeous one. Serenades may be used to advantage,
but care must be taken in selecting the songs and the windows. To a <i>blonde</i>
you may very well sing, "Thy eyes so blue, of
violet hue;" to a <i>brunette</i>, "Black-eyed Mary" or Susan; to a
bleached <i>blonde</i>,
"I am
dying, Egypt, dying." Never sing vulgar songs, which are used by hungry
lovers of cooks, such as, "Wilt thou meat me to-night by the old garden
gate," or, "Meat me by moonlight alone."</p>
      <p>CHAPTER III.</p>
      <p>BRINGING DOWN THE GAME.</p>
      <p>Nowhere is more real skill required than here; If you do not
make a dead
shot, you might better have saved your ammunition. Almost every wounded
bird escapes. Always make sure of your aim, and, when you fire, bring
down the bird. The proper course to pursue is this: carefully use your
ammunition, and, when you think things are favorable, and you get a
good
sight, make your shot. You can always deliver it best on your knees. Be
careful that there is no little sister or brother around when you go in
for business, for snickering is catching, and the bird may fly before
you have delivered your shot.</p>
      <p>Some shady nook is the proper place in which to do this part
of the
business, unless the weather be cold; in that case I have known game to
be brought down by a sportsman in the hall, where the house was heated
by hot air. Parent birds sometimes interrupt the sportsman just as he
imagines that he has a sure thing, which certainly is very aggravating.
Game properly brought down drops upon your left shoulder, and you
judiciously apply your lips to its bill. After that a proper amount of
hugging is advantageous and nice, but be very careful not to keep the
parent birds up too late.</p>
      <p>CHAPTER IV.</p>
      <p>BAGGING THE GAME.</p>
      <p>This should always be done in the very best style. First-class
churches,
and two or three parsons, can generally bag you and the bird properly.
Notice of the bagging should always be given to your friends, and the
bag should be large enough to hold not only the bird, but also any
first-class houses, greenbacks, or silver-ware which may be furnished
by
the friends of the bird. They say that BROWN, of Grace Church,
understands all the details of this kind of bagging. The game should be
elegantly dressed for the occasion, at the expense of the parent birds,
of course. You must take care that the bag is so tied that the bird
cannot escape, though they do say that, if you go to the neighborhood
of
Chicago, the bird will escape, even if the bag is fastened in the most
careful manner. I advise you, therefore, not to emigrate in that
direction.</p>
      <p>By the aid of the foregoing lessons any man should be enabled
to catch a
bird which, in the course of a month, he will wish he had left alone.</p>

      <p><b>THE WINTER FASHIONS.</b></p>
      <p>Owing to the war in France, which has deprived this country of
the usual
Paris fashions, it has been feared that no clothes would be worn by the
fashionable world this winter; but, fortunately, Mr. PUNCHINELLO is
enabled to announce that such will not be the case. Garments of various
kinds will be in vogue, and the following descriptions of some of them
may prove useful and interesting to the <i>beau monde:</i>&#8212;</p>
      <p>Gentlemen will wear business coats with sleeves. The will open
and
button in front. Coats buttoning behind now meet with no favor from the
strictly fashionable classes. Coats for evening and dress occasions,
however, will open behind as well as in front, but the will not open
all
the way up the back, unless in case of accident.</p>
      <p>Pantaloons will be worn on the legs, as last season, and they
will reach
below the knee.</p>
      <p>Vests will be worn under the coat this winter, and will have
pockets.
One of these is to be appropriated to the watch, and the practice of
carrying it in the coat-tail pocket will be entirely abandoned, as it
is
now considered neither convenient nor stylish.</p>
      <p>Collars will be worn around the neck, as last season, and
cravats will
tie in front. The "Greeley" style is, however, an exception to this
rule. It is considered the correct thing, among gentlemen of position
in
the fashionable world, to wear a cotton or linen shirt under their
ordinary suits. Only a small portion of this garment must be exposed,&#8212;a
part of the bosom, for instance. Handkerchiefs should be hemmed.
Stockings are to be worn, this year, under the boots, and although a
different arrangement may be allowed to old gentlemen, in icy and
sleety weather, it is not considered proper to wear woollen or other
stockings over the boots at evening parties or other social reunions.
Black is the favorite color for boots, and the most <i>recherch&eacute;</i>
and
convenient style is that in which small loops are placed at the top of
the boot-leg, one on each side, so that they may be drawn on after
having been taken off; thus avoiding the necessity of wearing them at
all times. Any one who dislikes sleeping in boots will appreciate this
arrangement. Gloves will be made with separate compartments for the
fingers, and few persons now wear the old-fashioned mitten at the
opera.
The best fastenings for gentlemen's clothing will be found to be
buttons. No gentleman, having tried these, will be any longer content
with hooks and eyes.</p>
      <p>In regard to the fashion for ladies, Mr. PUNCHINELLO cannot
now enter
into details, but he will give a slight description of a few novelties.
Frocks, or, as they are now called, dresses, will be worn this winter.
Those with skirts are considered much the most stylish. Corsets still
maintain a firm hold upon the female portion of the community, and
hoop-skirts will not be worn outside of the clothing this winter, but
will be tastefully concealed.</p>
      <p>Ultra fashionable ladies will wear shoes and stockings this
season, not
only in the street, but in the house, and Mr. PUNCHINELLO is glad to
see
the favor accorded to so sensible a fashion. Children will dress very
much as the means of their parents allow, but as a rule, their clothes
will be cut smaller that those of the adult members of the family.</p>

is located
on the Seine, which is the name of a river that divides it. It is also
divided by some other things, principally political feeling. Paris is
well known by travellers. It has been in its present location more than
a thousand years, and will probably remain some time longer. Although
it
has frequently been moved by great events, it is as stationary as any

with the
elephant or hippopotamus, and only the most ignorant persons would
suppose any connection between them. It flies through the air, as birds
generally do, and though not lazy it lays. The eggs of this bird are
valuable. When properly hatched they produce young pigeons, which often
grow up and go into the express business like their parents. The

goes to a great many places. He has an inspired confidence that in the

      <p>CANTO XV.</p>
      <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Sing a song of sixpence, a
pocketfull of rye,</span><br>
      <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Four and twenty blackbirds baked
in a pie.</span><br>
      <span style="margin-left: 2em;">When the pie was opened the birds
began to sing;</span><br>
      <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Wasn't that a dainty dish to set
before the king?</span><br>
      <p>The poet had now reached that stage of parental experience
where he
realized to its fullest extent, what many another poor mortal has
learned to his sorrow, that a baby in the house is the greatest tyrant
ever invented. A baby may be a well-spring of joy, a gleam of bright
sunshine, an angel from Heaven, a compound of unalloyed blissfulness,
or
a mixture of "snaps and snails and puppy dogs' tails;" but it is
nevertheless the tyrant of the household, the king of the family, the
royal personage to whom all must bow, and to whom everything must
yield.
What father or mother is there who dares set his or her will up in
opposition to the baby. If baby wants papa's spectacles, it must have
them, no matter if papa is reading. If it wants mamma's thimble, it has
it. If baby wants to go to sleep, the whole family must move on
tip-toe,
and not speak above a whisper. If baby gets the croup at night, the
whole family must be aroused, papa must run two miles to the doctor's,
grandmother must be routed from her warm bed and brought post-haste to
help take care of it, everybody from the cook upwards must stir about
lively and be on the watch ready any moment to offer their devotional
incense at the shrine of this potent baby monarch, the wee ruler who's
slightest wish has greater weight than the king's command.</p>
      <p>It is owing to this peculiarity of our humanity which always
has been
and always will be, that the world has received the remarkable lines
placed at the heading of this article. Since the Poet's time there have
been attempts by other aspirants to immortality to continue the story
so
well begun, and add a lengthy jingle to the already completed verse,
conceiving in their futile minds the idea that it was an unfinished
structure upon which they could build for themselves a temple of fame;
but all such dastardly attempts met with the success they deserved, and
that was speedy oblivion; and we contend and will maintain to the
bitter
end, that these lines are the only right and true lines written on the
subject by our immortal Poet, and that the others which are falsely
circulated as part and parcel of the original, are spurious, emanating,
it is said, from a half-insane idiot who hung himself immediately after
finishing them.</p>
      <p>The inspiration to the above lines came about in a very
natural way. The
Poet was poor. That is, speaking after the manner of later days, he was
occasionally hard-up. His occasions were very lengthy ones and the
interregnum a period remarkably brief. It had become a sort of chronic
state with him, and although he occasionally wrote a bit of verse by
request, his modesty would not allow him to charge more than a sixpence
or thereabouts for any article, and the consequence was that he
understood to the fullest extent the meaning of the term hard times.
Now
it is a well-known fact that families, especially where there are wives
and babies, do not take kindly to poverty and its concomitants, but
emphatically insist upon having something to eat, drink, and wear.</p>
      <p>Time has proved that even the weakest are wise in their own
way, and are
given knowledge for self-protection; and woman, although she may not
command success by main strength, nor by force of will, has learned
that
when other resources fail she has only to stoop to conquer: that her
weakness is her strength, her tears her weapons, and her baby her
shield. So when the Poet's politic little wife found there was no money
forthcoming, and consequently no dinner, she advised him to go hunting
for birds, as it was very necessary for growing children to have the
little bones to pick; not that she cared for a pie made from birds
herself, but it was really necessary for the child just at this age.</p>
      <p>Off sets the duped husband in a spirit of self-sacrifice,
determined
that no negligence of his shall prevent his child from growing
properly;
and if birds are necessary to the process, then birds it shall be. A
weary day is spent tramping among the woods and bushes, and towards
night, with two dozen of the feathered creatures in his bag, he turns
his footsteps homeward. He is rewarded by a smile and a word of praise
for his unusual good luck, and with a pat on the shoulder and a promise
of a splendid dinner in an hour or two, he is set to work to pluck the
birds.</p>
      <p>Time passes on, the savory smell of the cooking birds
occasionally
saluting his nostrils and making his mouth water with anticipation,
when
at last comes the joyful summons, and all seat themselves around the
table and engage with unbounded admiration in this wonderful issue of
the day's labor.</p>
      <p>The little lever which has moved the mighty events to this
result sits
in his high chair, a spoon in one hand, a fork in the other, and beats
a
grand tattoo ornamented with numerous little shrill sounds of baby joy,
in honor of the glorious sight, the like of which his eyes have never
seen before. Father and mother gaze enraptured upon the joyful sight of
the crowing youngster, exchange intelligent and admiring glances at his
precocity, and inwardly congratulate themselves upon possessing such a
wonderful improvement on babies in general.</p>
      <p>But the Poet himself, with his sensitive nature&#8212;who can fathom
the
profound depths of his soul now stirred by two such entrancing sights
as
the high-smoking blackbird-pie won by his own prowess, and the little
monarch for whose sake all this was brought about? The delicious smell
excites him like draughts of rich old wine, and all the soul within him
bubbles up exultingly, and he improvises on the moment. Joyfully he
sings in melodious tones, his nerves trembling with ecstasy, and his
blood bubbling through his veins like sparkling champagne:&#8212;</p>
      <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Sing a song of sixpence, a pocket
full of rye, </span><br>
      <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Four and twenty blackbirds baked
in a pie. </span><br>
      <span style="margin-left: 2em;">When the pie was opened the birds
began to sing; </span><br>
      <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Wasn't that a dainty dish to set
before the king?</span><br>
      <p>One adoring glance at the rosy little king, who sits with open
mouth and
spoon poised in air, staring in amazement at such unusual hilarity; one
comprehensive glance at his wife, and the keen knife and fork pierce to
the depth of the dainty dish, and the delicate blackbirds come forth;
but they do not sing. That was poetic license. Perhaps, on the whole,
it
was just as well that they did not sing, for it would only have delayed
the dinner, and hungry folks are rather practical, and would much
prefer
testing the birds for themselves to hearing from them.</p>
      <p>The event of the day is over. Quiet has settled upon the earth
and upon
the Poet's household. He leans back in his chair in peaceful revery,
and
muses upon the scenes of the day. Slowly, like distant music, come back
to his mind the diamonds of thought that dropped from his lips under
the
unwonted excitement, and as he strings them together he jots them down
in his memorandum for future service.</p>

      <p>Turnin full onto me (and Ketchin my cote sleeve), she says,
"Oh! you
black villian, how dare you insult a lady?" Tearin myself from her
grasp, I rushed madly on. I could feel pedestrians glide by me.</p>
      <p>There I was in a strange land. From all sides it was,
smoke&#8212;smoke&#8212;smoke, darkness&#8212;darkness&#8212;darkness. Ide read about the
Egipshun darkness, but Pittsburgh is ahead of that, for while I
couldent
see in Pittsburgh, the blamed smoke was suffocatin me, and makin the
teers run down my cheeks, like the prodigal son, when he was mournin
for
the deth of a rich unkle, who'd left him some cash, I made up my mind,
that I would try and enter a bildin somewhere, and implore the ade of a
pilot.</p>
      <p>Hearin voices, I made a bee line from whence issood the voise.
After
tumblin over severil dry goods boxes, I went head first throo a big
glass winder, and landed my voluptous form at the feet of the cerprised
groceryman, who was engaged in the lofty pursoot of measurin out a peck
of onions. "See here! my cullered friend," says he, takin me by the
cote
collar, and marchin me up to view the ruin, which I had made. "Yoove
smashed a ten doller pane of glass. Come, shell out the damage, or ile
call a policeman." I tride to remonstrate with him agin his callin me a
cullered man, at which he agin insisted on my payin for broken glass,
&amp;c. To avoid further discussion, I planked down the required
ammount,
and flew into the street, with my mind vergin onto madness.</p>
      <p>Why, oh! why? was I addressed as a "blackraskil," "scoundrel,"
&amp;c.? was
the thoughts which was ruunin' throo my mind.</p>
      <p>Bringin my hands to my eyes, a terrible suspishon flashed
across my
brain, as I diskivered to my horror, that my usually lilly white hands
had turned black.</p>
      <p>I couldent stand such feelins as I was in, for a great while.</p>
      <p>Feelin along the side of numerous houses, I found my way into
another
store.</p>
      <p>"Mister STOREKEEPER, who am I?&#8212;and what am I?" said I, wildly
interogatin a individual, who was standin by a big pile of caliker.</p>
      <p>"I should say you was a descendant of HAM, and a pooty well
died one
too," says he laffin.</p>
      <p>"Me black? impossible sir!" was my reply.</p>
      <p>He ceazed me by the hand and led me to a lookin glass.</p>
      <p>Yes, the terrible truth stared me in the face.</p>
      <p>I begun to realize my situation. It suddenly occurred to me,
that in the
confusion of changin cars that mornin, that, likely as not, I'de got
swapped off with some cullered preacher.</p>
      <p>With my feelins workt up to a traggick pitch, and madly cussin
the day
that I left Skeensboro, I staggered into the street.</p>
      <p>For a few minnits, I assumed the air and garbage of a
loonytick.</p>
      <p>I ran vilently again numerous individuals, and as the
concussion
generally piled me into the gutter, I quickly sprung to my feet, and
waved my umbreller wildly into the air.</p>
      <p>I was suddenly grabbed by the cote coller and moked into a
large bildin,
which I afterwards diskivered to be the Monongaheeler House. I found
myself confrontin a perliceman. Says I, strikin a tragick attitood, "Am
I GREEN, or am I not GREEN? If I haint GREEN, who in SAM HILL am I?"</p>
      <p>"Old man," said the porliceman, tryin to quiet me, "you mite
have been <i>green</i> before you struck Pittsburg, but if I haint
mistaken, yoo've
been out and got smoked up, and are now as <i>black</i> as the ase of
spades."</p>
      <p>"Oh! hor-ri-ble, hor-ri-ble!" I hissed, and rushed into the
washroom.</p>
      <p>After soakin my head in a wash-basin for a few minnits, reezin
agin
returned, and I diskivered, to my disgust, that I had been sold by the
consarned smoke a settin down onto me. Well, Mister PUNCHINELLO, it was
a narrer escape for the old man, you bet. I wasent long in gettin
washed
up; and if ever a lone traveller was tickled to set foot onto a rale
rode car homeward bound, it was your hily intelectual and venerable
quill jerkist.</p>
      <p>I told Mrs. GREEN of my adventoor. It emejetly sot her into
one of her
cranky tantrums. Says she, "HIRAM, you've an old fool. Why don't you
stay home, where you belong, and not go pokin about the country like a
great big booby?"</p>
      <p>"But, my dear," was my reply, "GEORGE FRANCIS TRAIN got up his
name by
gittin into musses, and wastin and pinin away into furrin pastiles."</p>
      <p>"GEORGE FRANCIS your grandmother," said she. "You and he orter
be tide
together and caged. If I only had the keepin of you then, Ide nock the
foolishness out of your nozzles, or break your pesky old topknots in

to the

      <p>PART IV.</p>
      <p>THE GOLDEN GATE.</p>
      <p>An animated and picturesque view, fresh from the hand of
genius.</p>
      <p>The mellow sunshine, the birds fluttering in the air, the
ships dashing
through the briny deep, the foliage upon the hills in the dim distance,
the glittering steeples of the great city of El Dorado,&#8212;and one of
GEORGE LAW'S old man-traps in the foreground, with a high-pressure
boiler (you see there is an excursion party on board, with a band of
music), and an open bay,&#8212;all combine to lend to this wonderful triumph
of art an airy and exhilarating tone, indescribably delicious.</p>
      <p>This is the Golden Gate which guards the harbor of San
Francisco. It is
open and shut by means of an earthquake. This water, extending in every
direction, is the well-known Pacific Ocean. They have called this the <i>Golden</i>
Gate, because somewhere in this vicinity the
precious metal
was discovered, accidentally, as it were.</p>
      <p>Observe the skill&#8212;with which our artist has distinguished land
from
water; trees from ships; clouds from church spires; human beings from
Chinamen. In so doing, he has distinguished himself also.</p>
      <p>In view of these sloops on the extreme left, may we not say
that this is
a mast apiece?</p>
      <p>This exquisite gem was completed about the same time as the
Pacific
Railroad, and yet how different. Here the eye of the beholder lingers
fondly upon the scene, drinking in at every point new and inspiring
beauties. I presume that the traveller upon the Union Pacific may drink
at every point if he wants to, but he can't linger. Their time-table
doesn't allow it.</p>
      <p>I forgot to mention that in the background can be detected
glimpses of
the great State of California.</p>
      <br>
      <p>BOTANY BAY.</p>
      <p>What emotions arise in the breast as you approach this
remarkable spot!
Tour mind naturally reverts to your English ancestry, to those early
settlers, the noble forefathers of this colony, who forsook their old
homes and braved the perils of the deep till they reached these distant
shores. They came not from a feverish thirst for gold, nor with
ambitious visions of a new and powerful empire. They came rather from a
      <i>conviction</i>, that here was where they were wanted.</p>
      <p>This crowded canvas gives you some faint idea of what has been
the
result of that generous, patriotic pilgrimage.</p>
      <p>This is Felon's Avenue.</p>
      <p>Burglar's Hall,&#8212;a fine public building,&#8212;Headman's Block, The
College
of Forgery, Counterfeiter's Exchange, The Cracksman's Crib, (a new and
elegant hotel), Mutiny Row, and many other prominent buildings are to
be
seen.</p>
      <p>Such are the natural beauties of the place that persons who
come here
feel compelled to stay a good while. (The melodeon will evolve "Home,
sweet home.")</p>
      <br>
      <p>THE NATURAL BRIDGE OF VIRGINIA.</p>
      <p>Next to Mount Vernon, the Libby Prison at Richmond, and John
Brown's
Engine House at Harper's Ferry, this is to the stranger the most
interesting piece of scenery in the Old Dominion. So firm and
substantial is the masonry that it is supposed to have been standing
long before the English settlement of the country. Some learned writers
think that those stately abutments are too massive for the red man of
the forest to have constructed. Besides, what did he know about
engineering? I'm sure I can't say how this is; but I had always
supposed
that there never was a camp of these savages without an Indian near.</p>
      <p>At all events the effect is very natural, and it only needs a
toll-house
to render it completely so.</p>
      <p>This dizzy elevation has been scaled by daring adventurers who
cut their
names in the soft, yielding rock; not so many, it is true, of late
years. They have rather fallen off.</p>
      <p>There is food for contemplation in this beautiful object; also
in the
hotel which you perceive not far off.</p>
      <br>
      <p>NIGHT ON THE PRAIRIE.</p>
      <p>This represents a very dark night, with no moon, exceedingly
cloudy, and
all the fires out. You will be struck with the interesting fact that a
night on the prairie, under such circumstances, looks very much like a
similar night elsewhere.</p>
      <br>
      <p>SUNRISE, ON THE PRAIRIE.</p>
      <p>People who have never seen the sun rise on the prairie, or
anywhere
else, say that this is exactly like it.</p>
      <p>These two vivid representations of our Western domain are the
efforts of
two boys, both of them brothers. One panted for fame. So did the other.
That made a pair of pants.</p>
      <p>Both miners, they mixed a good deal with rough people, in fact
from the
cradle up. They mixed paints well. They did this job in gangs of one
each.</p>
      <p>One of these boys has grown up and dyed. His bones are
bleaching on the
plains of Arkansas. He is carrying on an extensive dye-house and
bleachery in the suburbs of Little Rock.</p>
      <p>The other boy, I hardly know whether he has grown up or not.
He was a
pattern young man. The last I heard of him he was making patterns for a
large manufacturing establishment at Pittsburgh.</p>
      <br>
      <p>BOSTON.</p>
      <p>An exceedingly accurate view of the City of Boston and
vicinity. The
vicinity has all been annexed; so it is Boston proper. All Boston is
proper&#8212;very proper.</p>
      <p>This view was taken by BLACK, a distinguished artist. Colored
men draw
better in Boston. The picture was originally a small one, taken by
photograph, and then "thrown up," as the technical term is. Our artist
threw it up for pecuniary reasons. I have forgotten the man's name who
took it again. I think he said his name was SHERIFF.</p>
      <p>The spectator is supposed to be standing just in front of the
foreground, except where this perspective comes in; then he is perched,
with a smoked glass, in the look-out at the top of the State House.</p>
      <p>Boston Common; the Harbor; the Mall on the Common; Fort
Warren; the Old
Elm Tree on the Common; Bunker Hill Monument; Fountain on the Common;
Park Street Church, orthodox&#8212;these other docks are at East Boston;
Children of the Public Schools playing on the Common; Faneuil Hall;
Frog
Pond on the Common; the Public Garden, etc.</p>
      <p>The Great Organ is played at about this point. Travellers from
New York
frequently come upon the Sound when miles away.</p>
      <p>We would like to show one or two of the important men of
Boston, but the
artist assured us we hadn't room.</p>
      <p>Boston is high-toned. I believe the taxes here are higher than
in any
other city in the country. I would like to say a good deal more about
Boston, but being a Boston man myself, my modesty prevents me. You will
always notice this peculiarity in a Boston man&#8212;he seldom mentions
Boston. It is a way we have in Boston.</p>

MONTGOMERY has been playing "HAMLET" and "OTHELLO" at
NIBLO'S
GARDEN. So graceful and elegant is he in his stage presence, that I
have
been obliged to decline to take MARGARET to see him. There is nothing
so
annoying as to escort one's cousin (I think I have mentioned that
MARGARET is my cousin) to the theatre and to hear her express the most
ecstatic admiration of that "perfectly lovely Mr. MONTGOMERY." I have
suffered from this sort of thing once, and don't propose to subject
myself to it a second time. I do not consider myself a jealous man, but
as Mr. GUPPY finely and forcibly remarks, "there <i>are</i> chords in
the
human breast."</p>
      <p>Last week, I referred in pointed, not to say Greeleyesque
language, to
the REFORMING NUISANCES who insist upon improving everything according
to their own fashion. The NUISANCE, however, has this peculiarity, that
he never wants to change anything that really needs to be reformed. He
will insist upon bullying Mr. TILTON into total abstinence from the
mildest form of claret and water, but he never thinks of urging Mr.
GREELEY to a wholesome moderation in the use of objurgatory epithets.
He
is clamorous in his demand that <i>Rip Van Winkle</i> should be
transformed
into a temperance lecture, but he is entirely satisfied with the
preposterous manner in which the clever but inartistic SHAKESPEARE has
thought fit to end his two meritorious tragedies, <i>Hamlet</i> and <i>Othello</i>.
Now no one at all familiar with either of these
two popular
plays can fail to perceive the gross faults of construction which
characterize them both.</p>
      <p>To be sure, if we accept the theory of "HAMLET'S" insanity, we
can
account for the preposterous idiocy of his conduct. But from the
greatest to the worst of our interpreters of "HAMLET,"&#8212;from BOOTH to
FECHTER,&#8212;there is no modern actor who believes in the real insanity of
the melancholy Dane. The fault of his folly, therefore, lies with the
dramatist, and not the actor.</p>
      <p>What does "HAMLET" do when he decides&#8212;on the unsworn statement
of an
irresponsible GHOST&#8212;that his father has been murdered by the GHOST'S
brother? We all know that he devotes himself to the duties of a private
detective; that he drives his sweetheart crazy by using very improper
language to her, and by coolly denying that he had ever had any serious
intentions toward her. Then he gets up the worst specimen of private
theatricals that even a royal drawing-room ever witnessed,&#8212;a
performance so hopelessly stupid as to actually make the KING and his
consort seriously ill. Next he insults his mother, and, under the weak
pretext of killing rats, wantonly makes a hole in her best tapestry.
And
finally, after having killed the young man who was to have been his
brother-in-law, he stabs his own uncle and calmly watches the dying
agonies of his mother, who has succumbed to an indiscreet indulgence in
adulterated whiskey. His death is the only redeeming incident in his
career,&#8212;only he should have died in the first, instead of the fifth
act.</p>
      <p>The real "HAMLET"&#8212;if there ever was such a person&#8212;would have
shown the
traditional thrift and enterprise of his race by a very different
course
of conduct. After the interview with the GHOST he would have had a
private audience with the KING, and there would have ensued a scene
somewhat like the following one. Of course he would not have talked in
blank verse. The world has never properly condemned the outrageous
cheek
with which SHAKESPEARE has attempted to make us believe that blank
verse
was ever the ordinary speech of sensible men.</p>
      <p>HAMLET.&#8212;"I have a little business to settle with your majesty."</p>
      <p>KING.&#8212;"Well! out with it; I've got an appointment with the
German
Ambassador about that Schleswig-Holstein business at 2 o'clock, and can
only spare you ten minutes."</p>
      <p>HAMLET.&#8212;"I want to be appointed collector of the port of
Copenhagen,
with a salary of ten thousand dollars a month besides the fees. Also, I
want to marry OPHELIA, and to be recognized as the heir apparent to
your
throne."</p>
      <p>KING.&#8212;"Well! I rather like your cheek. Do you mistake me for
an
American President, that you ask me to appoint one of my own relations
to the fattest office in my gift? Why you impertinent young scoundrel!"</p>
      <p>HAMLET.&#8212;"Draw it mild, if you please. The reason why I ask
these favors
of you is, that if granted they will prevent me from talking in my
sleep."</p>
      <p>KING (<i>aside</i>).&#8212;"He's got 'em at last. I knew he would,
if he kept
company with politicians." (<i>To Hamlet.</i>) "Are you drunk or crazy?
Not
that it is of much consequence, but still I should like to know the
reason of this impudence."</p>
      <p>HAMLET (<i>in a sepulchral whisper</i>).&#8212;"Uncle! I have seen a
reliable
gentleman who saw my late father die. Now don't do anything rash. You
see I know all. Appoint me collector, and I'll agree to think no more
about it. Refuse, and I shall take the course that filial love and duty
prompt."</p>
      <p>KING.&#8212;"There is no need of any dispute between relatives on
such a
little matter as this appointment. I appreciate your business capacity.
Swear to forget the nonsense you have hinted at, and you shall be
collector. Is it a bargain?"</p>
      <p>HAMLET.&#8212;"It is."</p>
      <p>Here the play would naturally end, and the audience would feel
that both
"HAMLET" and the "KING" had conducted themselves in a creditable
manner.
By such a change as this, <i>Hamlet</i> becomes a rational and
enjoyable
play. But will, you ever find a REFORMING NUISANCE who will offer to
improve <i>Hamlet</i>? Not a bit of it. There is nothing which your
NUISANCE
is more reluctant to do than to engage in any really useful work.</p>
      <p>"OTHELLO" is another idiotic person, who spoils what would
otherwise
have been a respectable play, by his stupid jealousy. How much better
would the drama have been had the fifth act proceeded in this wise:&#8212;</p>
      <p>OTHELLO.&#8212;"Desdy, my dear, are you in bed?"</p>
      <p>DESDEMONA.&#8212;"Yes, and I'm sleepy too, and don't want to be
bothered.
There's your night-shirt hanging on the chair."</p>
      <p>OTHELLO.&#8212;"IAGO tells me you've been flirting with Lieutenant
CASSIO.
Now that won't do. Remember that under the Fifteenth Amendment I have
the right, being a colored man, of doing pretty much as I choose. If
this flirtation isn't stopped promptly I'll go to Indiana, divorce you,
and marry EMILIA. Do you know where the boot-jack is?"</p>
      <p>DESDEMONA.&#8212;"I never did flirt with him, and IAGO tells a big
story if
he says I did. The boot-jack must have been kicked under the bed. As
for
flirting, after the way you have gone on with EMILIA, the less say
about
it the better. If you can't find the boot-jack, call the servant and
let
him pull your boots off&#8212;you'll catch your death if you go poking round
under the bureau and sofa and things much longer."</p>
      <p>OTHELLO.&#8212;"Of course it's all right, only don't have too much
to say to
him. There's that confounded boot-jack at last. You see, my dear, that
people will talk if you give them the slightest reason. There's a
button
off this shirt. Are you all ready for me to put the gas out?"</p>
      <p>With the extinction of the gas, the curtain would naturally
fall. And it
would fall upon a pleasant, well-constructed, probable, and eminently
realistic play. As it is, OTHELLO ends with a complicated massacre
worthy of the Bowery Theatre in its bloodiest days.</p>

      <p>The nations of Europe appear to suppose that their advance in
civilization is marked by improvement in their rifles rather than in
their school-houses. The possession of the needle-gun by Prussia
stimulated France to invent the Chassepot, and now it appears that
Russia claims to have a new rifle which surpasses them both. If we may
judge from Prussia's actions in this war, this improvement in rifles
leads to improvement in rifling; and though it is difficult to imagine
how Russia could surpass Prussia's proficiency in this art, which in
civil parlance would be called robbing, yet there is no knowing to what
further point of perfection it may be carried. It is only to be hoped
that the industry of Europe, which offers the field for the exercise of
these improvements, will continue to be piously thankful for the noble
position which it is thus made to hold in the march of progress.</p>

      <p>Astronomers say that there is no water on the moon's surface.
We, on the
contrary, know that there are large oceans there. No one ever heard of
ship captains in a place destitute of water; and, as the moon is made
of
green cheese, there must of course be "skippers" there.</p>

      <p><b>PROTECTION PROTECTED.</b></p>
      <p>A Western editor has issued a conundrum in a volume with the
title <i>Does
Protection Protect?</i> and undertakes to prove by statistics that
answer
is No. These Western people are in the habit, we know, of bragging a
good deal of their exploits, and so the writer referred to says he used
to think the answer to his conundrum was Yes, but investigation has
shown him he was wrong. What business has he to investigate it? There
is
Mr. GREELEY, he says the answer is YES!! and does any one suppose that
he ever investigated it, or could so investigate any subject as to
change his opinion about it? Of course not.</p>
      <p>Then there is H.C. CAREY, who used to say, when he was
interested in
statistics, that the answer was No; but now that he is more interested
in mining, he says the answer is Yes. Could there be any better proof
that the Western man is wrong?</p>
      <p>Besides, has not Mr. KELLEY proved a thousand times that
protection does
protect his constituents, and that by making everybody pay dearer for
iron, the money goes where, according to the true laws of trade, it
ought to go&#8212;into the pockets of the mine-owners? Can it be possible
that the castor-oil man, the thread man, the salt man, the steel man,
and all the others of this kind, don't know that protection protects
them, and that they are the important persons in the country?</p>
      <p>If this freedom of inquiry is allowed much longer, protection
itself
will have to be protected. Let that Western editor prosecute his
studies
further, until he becomes convinced that Americans are naturally a
lazy,
idle, and shiftless people, and never would, or could, engage in any
industry unless they were so protected in it that it can be made as
flourishing as ship-building, machine-shops, and manufactures of all
kinds are now. Or, if he thinks that would take too much time, let him
join some snug little ring, if he can find such a vacancy, and enjoy
the
reflection, when Republican orators talk of the glorious results of
protection to American industry, that he is one of the glorious results.</p>

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
